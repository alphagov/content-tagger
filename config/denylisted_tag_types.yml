    # Contacts pages like https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/agent-dedicated-line-debt-management
    # have a breadcrumb to the HMRC contact page (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact)
    # Allowing to tag to the parent here would be confusing to the user.

  travel-advice-publisher:
    # This is  a temporary workaround for the fact that 'parent' links
    # can sometimes be blobs of JSON (containing a breadcrumb, for example)
    # rather than the array of content IDs content-tagger currently expects. We
    # need to either improve the editing interface in content tagger to somehow
    # support this or wait until the publishing API no longer allows writing of
    # arbitrary JSON to the parent link, and we support tagging to arbitrary
    # pages.

  whitehall:
    # The parent (breadcrumb) is managed in Whitehall itself. This
    # will stay that way because Whitehall is too complex to make a half-way
    # change to a system where breadcrumb is read & written from
    # the publishing-api.
    #
    # Whitehall does send this information to the publishing-api so it can still
    # be used as a source of information.
    - parent

    # Organisation tagging is done in Whitehall, because its data model is too
    # much intertwined with organisations to make it read/write this tag from
    # publishing-api.

  specialist-publisher:
    # Documents owned by specialist-publisher are automatically tagged to
    # organisations via a harcoded list per document type. In the
    # specialist-publisher rebuild this could be changed to be a default. When
    # that has happened we could allow modifying the `organisations` link type
    # here as well.
    - organisations

    # Documents owned by specialist-publisher currently don't have a breadcrumb,
    # to avoid confusion we disable tagging to a `parent` until we've unified
    # the navigation.

  service-manual-publisher:
    # The service-manual-publisher automatically tags everything to the GDS
    # organisation and overwrites the `organisations` link type on each publish.
